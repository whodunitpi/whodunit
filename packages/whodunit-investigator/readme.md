# Investigator 

> Rails-inspired investigator system that provides scaffolding for your apps

## Getting Started

If you're interested in writing your own whodunit investigator we recommend reading [the official getting started guide](http://whodunit.io/authoring/). The guide covers all the basics you need to get started.

A investigator can be as complex as you want it to be. It can simply copy a bunch of boilerplate files, or it can be more advanced asking the user's preferences to scaffold a tailor made project. This decision is up to you.

After reading the getting started guide, you might want to read the code source or visit our [API documentation](http://whodunit.io/investigator/) for a list of all methods available.
